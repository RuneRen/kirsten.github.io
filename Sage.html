            <div class="ability-title">Barrier Orb (C)</div>
            <p>Sage's barrier orb allows her to place a wall that fortifies after a few seconds.
                She can place it however she wants, just not vertically.
                The wall has 400 hp when newly places but turns into 800 after it fortifies, unless it is broken by the enemy.
              You can use it once per round if you buy it for 400cred.
            </p>

            <div class="ability-title">Slow Orb (Q)</div>
            <p>Sage throws a slow orb that creates a field of ice wherever it lands on.
                It slows everyone who are in it, enemy or teammate.
              You can use it twice per round after buying it for 200creds.
            </p>

            <div class="ability-title">Healing Orb (E)</div>
            <p>This is Sage's signature ability. 
                Sage uses the healing orb to either heal her teammate or herself.
                When she heals a teammate, it restores 100 of their hp, but if she heals herself it only restores 50 of her hp.
                It doesn't restore shield health.
                You can use it for free but has a cooldown of 45 seconds.
              </p>

            <div class="ability-title">Resurrection (X)</div>
            <p>Sage uses this to ressurect a dead ally, restoring their full hp, or depending on the teammates ultimate, it can restore it too.
                Unfortunately, she cannot ressurect herself.
              You get this ultimate after gathering 7 points from either kills, deaths, or orbs.</p>
