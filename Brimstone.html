            <div class="ability-title">Stim Beacon (C)</div>
            <p>Brimstone's stim beacon is like a buff for him and his team. 
                When tossed down, it creates a small field that gives players a combat stim and a speed boost.
              You can use it once per round if you buy it for 200cred.

            <div class="ability-title">Incendiary (Q)</div>
            <p>Brim has an incendiary that it sort of like a grenade but when detonates onto the floor it creates a field for fire that damages any player withine that field.
              You can use it once per round after buying it for 250creds.

            <div class="ability-title">Sky Smoke (E)</div>
            <p>This is Brim's signature ability. 
                He opens a map on his pad, then chooses where he wants to place the smoke which lasts for 19seconds.
                You can use the first smoke for free but you have to buy the other 2 smokes for 100creds.
              </p>

            <div class="ability-title">Orbital Strike (X)</div>
            <p>Like his signature ability, he can open up a map on his pad and can choose the location where he wants the orbital strike laser to happen.
                It is hard to survive the strike especially if the player is in a closed space.
                It damages any player withing it's range.
              You get this ultimate after gathering 8 points from either kills, deaths, or orbs.</p>
