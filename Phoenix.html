            <div class="ability-title">Blaze (C)</div>
            <p>Phoenix creates a wall of fire that blocks vision and damages anyone passing through it. 
              The wall can be curved by turning while casting. 
              This ability is useful for cutting off enemy sightlines, blocking entrances, and providing temporary cover for strategic moves, or using Blaze to heal yourself.
              You can use it once per round if you buy it for 150creds.
            </p>

            <div class="ability-title">Hot Hands (Q)</div>
            <p>Phoenix throws a fireball that explodes after a delay or upon impact with the ground, creating a zone of fire that damages enemies and heals Phoenix. 
              This ability is great for area denial, healing yourself in a pinch, or flushing out enemies from cover.
              You can use it once per round after buying it for 200creds
            </p>

            <div class="ability-title">Curveball (E)</div>
            <p>This is Phoenix's signature ability. 
                Phoenix throws a flare orb that moves in a curve, bursting into brilliant light after a brief delay, temporarily blinding everyone who looks at it, even your own teammates. 
                This ability is effective for initiating pushes, and disorienting opponents.
                It recharges after you get 2 kills.
                You can buy it for 250 creds.
              </p>

            <div class="ability-title">Run It Back (X)</div>
            <p>Phoenix marks his current location. 
              If he is killed during the ability's duration, or when the ability's timer expires, he is reborn at the marked location with full health. 
              This ultimate is ideal for aggressive plays, scouting enemy positions, and taking risks without the fear of permanent death. 
                You get this ultimate after gathering 6 points from either kills, deaths, or orbs.</p>
